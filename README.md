medRxiv preprint doi: <https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.09.24311696>

## Data files

Datasets of the 3 cohorts used in this study can be accessed via zenodo (link to be updated) upon request.

**Note:** please place the data files within the same working directory after downloading them from zenodo.

1.  `Data dictionary.xlsx`
2.  `Ottawa_cut.csv`: Ottawa (PREDIGT) Trial (baseline)
3.  `PROBE_cut.csv`: Prognostic Biomarkers in Parkinson’s Disease Study (PROBE; baseline)
4.  `DeNoPa_cut.csv`: “*De Novo* Parkinson disease study” (DeNoPa; baseline, 48-month, and 72-month follow-up visits)

**Note:** the public accessible data files have gone through further de-identification steps to protect the identity of all study participants. If you wish to reproduce all the results in the manuscript, please contact the corresponding authors or cohort PIs to access the original data sets. The de-identification steps include:

1.  Transform continuous `age` to categorical `age_cat`: This will affect the results of Table 1, Supplemental Table 3, and Figure 7(b) in the medRxiv version.
2.  Remove `disease.duration`: This will affect the results of Table 1.
3.  Remove `race`, `ethnic`: These variables were not directly used to generate any results in the manuscript, but were used to describe the race/ethnicity characteristics of the study cohorts.

## Supportive data

Included in the `Supportive data` folder in this repo:

1.  `diagnosis colors.csv`: colors representing each diagnostic groups for plotting.
2.  `Published rankings.csv`: 8 previously published scent rankings, 4 for SST-ID, 4 for UPSIT.
3.  `scent_shared.csv`: 11 scents that are shared by SST-ID and UPSIT. (**Note:** this file is generated by `4. Combine UPSIT and SST-ID.qmd`, but is also required by `1. Tables, distributions, ROCs.qmd` for plotting. So I included it here to avoid running error.)
4.  `SST_ID_option.csv`: Options provided for each SST-ID scent, used for generating ICCs.
5.  `UPSIT_key.csv`: answer keys of UPSIT.
6.  `UPSIT_option.csv`: Options provided for each UPSIT scent, used for generating ICCs.

## Code files

**Important:** This project used **TestGardener version 3.2.6**. TestGardener has had a major update recently (version 3.3.3) which includes various changes that are incompatible with code here. We will update the repo to accommodate the changes, but until that completes, please use **TestGardener version 3.2.6** to run this code. You can find it [here](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/TestGardener/)

## Supportive function

Supportive functions are placed in the `R` folder. These functions need to be sourced in `2. Abbreviated Smell Test SST-ID.qmd` and `4. Combine UPSIT and SST-ID.qmd`.

1.  `itemAUC.R`: calculate each scent's AUC values and rank them, using cross-validation
2.  `subsetAUC.R`: calculate each subset's AUC values.
3.  Modified `TestGardener` functions to generate ICCs: `make.dataList.R`, `Wbinsmth.R`, `eval_surp.R`, `ICC.plot.R`
